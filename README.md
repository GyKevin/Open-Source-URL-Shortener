# <p align="center">Open Source URL-Shortener</p>
<p>This project is an open source URL-Shortener originally made as a fullstack project for school.
I have since remade it from scratch to make it more accessible.
This url-shortener runs purely on PHP and MYSQL.</p>

## What is a URL-Shortener?
<p>URL shortening is a technique on the World Wide Web in which a Uniform Resource Locator may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required page. 
This is achieved by using a redirect which links to the web page that has a long URL.</p>
